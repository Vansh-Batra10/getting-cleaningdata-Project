subject:	ID of the 30 volunteers who performed the activity. Its range is from 1 to 30.
activity:	Activity type that the 30 volunteers who performed the activity.
 It has 6 levels:
 1. WALKING
 2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
 3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
 4. SITTING
 5. STANDING
 6. LAYING

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
Previously:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
The set of variables that were estimated (and kept for this assignment) from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

In the Tidy data set 
"tbodyacc.mean...x" "tbodyacc.mean...y" "tbodyacc.mean...z" "tbodyacc.std...x" "tbodyacc.std...y" "tbodyacc.std...z" "tgravityacc.mean...x" "tgravityacc.mean...y" "tgravityacc.mean...z" "tgravityacc.std...x" "tgravityacc.std...y" "tgravityacc.std...z" "tbodyaccjerk.mean...x" "tbodyaccjerk.mean...y" "tbodyaccjerk.mean...z" "tbodyaccjerk.std...x" "tbodyaccjerk.std...y" "tbodyaccjerk.std...z" "tbodygyro.mean...x" "tbodygyro.mean...y" "tbodygyro.mean...z" "tbodygyro.std...x" "tbodygyro.std...y" "tbodygyro.std...z" "tbodygyrojerk.mean...x" "tbodygyrojerk.mean...y" "tbodygyrojerk.mean...z" "tbodygyrojerk.std...x" "tbodygyrojerk.std...y" "tbodygyrojerk.std...z" "tbodyaccmag.mean.." "tbodyaccmag.std.." "tgravityaccmag.mean.." "tgravityaccmag.std.." "tbodyaccjerkmag.mean.." "tbodyaccjerkmag.std.." "tbodygyromag.mean.." "tbodygyromag.std.." "tbodygyrojerkmag.mean.." "tbodygyrojerkmag.std.." "fbodyacc.mean...x" "fbodyacc.mean...y" "fbodyacc.mean...z" "fbodyacc.std...x" "fbodyacc.std...y" "fbodyacc.std...z" "fbodyaccjerk.mean...x" "fbodyaccjerk.mean...y" "fbodyaccjerk.mean...z" "fbodyaccjerk.std...x" "fbodyaccjerk.std...y" "fbodyaccjerk.std...z" "fbodygyro.mean...x" "fbodygyro.mean...y" "fbodygyro.mean...z" "fbodygyro.std...x" "fbodygyro.std...y" "fbodygyro.std...z" "fbodyaccmag.mean.." "fbodyaccmag.std.." "fbodybodyaccjerkmag.mean.." "fbodybodyaccjerkmag.std.." "fbodybodygyromag.mean.." "fbodybodygyromag.std.." "fbodybodygyrojerkmag.mean.." "fbodybodygyrojerkmag.std..

The resulting variable names are of the following form: tbodyacc.mean...x, which means the mean value of tBodyAcc-XYZ.
